# Challenge - 19
## Budget Tracker (PWA)

- For the ninteenth challenge of my bootcamp, I am tasked with adding PWA functionality to an already existing web application. I will be researching and implementing service workers, indexedDB api functionality, and a manifest.json for the ability to download and use the application.

## User Story
---
- AS AN avid traveler
- I WANT to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
- SO THAT my account balance is accurate when I am traveling

GIVEN a budget tracker without an internet connection
> WHEN the user inputs an expense or deposit
- THEN they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit
> WHEN the user reestablishes an internet connection

## Weekly Reflection
---

- This week's assignment wasn't too difficult but was still challenging due to my recent issue of losing steam toward the end of this bootcamp. I understand what PWA's are used for and the unique additions we can add to an already created application to make sure it is at its peak functionality, whether its application size, or dealing with persisting data with the absence of internet connection. I'm very eager to get to the end of this 6 month journey and to finally put my all into job searching. I feel like I have pin pointed where I would like to improve with my understanding of full stack web development and the way to do that would be to throw myself at a job that is doing just that. I look forward to the day where I am able to solidify my grasp of these concepts while working my hardest for someone. Here's to another week!
